Linear Regression


Introduction
               Linear Regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variable
          
Boston Dataset
                
                I take the Housing dataset which contains information about different houses in Boston . There are 506 samples and 13 features in this dataset
                       
Challenge
               
               To predict the Value of prices of the house using the given features.
